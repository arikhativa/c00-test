## About
I am still working on this project.
It will be updated every ~day.

## How to use
* clone this repo next to you C repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arikhativa/pool-tester.git
```
The fs should look like this:
/
----/c00
----/pool-tester
* make sure the name of the C repo will be formatted like this - cXX
  * example - c00 / c01
* You can change the name with the mv cmd

```sh
mv <PROJECT_NAME> c00
```

* go into the pool-tester repo
* and run the tester with the correct flag

```sh
cd pool-tester
./test.sh -c00
```
