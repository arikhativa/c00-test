## About
I am still working on this project.
It will be updated every ~day.

## How to use
* clone this repo next to you C repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arikhativa/pool-tester.git
```
The dir should look like this:

```sh
ls -l

drwxr-xr-x  2 xx  2019  68 May 17 13:11 c00
drwxr-xr-x  2 xx  2019  68 May 17 13:12 pool-tester
```

* make sure the name of the C repo will be formatted like this - cXX
  * example - c00
* You can change the name with the mv cmd

```sh
mv <PROJECT_NAME> c00
```

* go into the pool-tester repo
* and run the tester with the correct flag
